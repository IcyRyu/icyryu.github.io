<p>I enjoy exploring my creativity through outlets such as programming, fashion, and origami! Particularly, I enjoy mathematics, puzzles, and patterns as I believe they form the fundamental pillars of how humans understand and interact with the world.</p>
<p>My goal is to expand upon my passions and spark interest for others in a profound way.</p>
